# PFRPG: Time Manager
This extension is a GM tool which provides an interface for easy time tracking and management.

This extension is no longer developed as [pr6i6e6st](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?60923-pr6i6e6st) (the original author) has resumed support of [Clock Adjuster](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?57561-Utility-Clock-Adjuster).
Plans in the works for this should be submitted to the original extension which now includes (at least most of) the modifications I have made to it.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.0.10 (2021-02-04).
