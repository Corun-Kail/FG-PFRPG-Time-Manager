# PFRPG: Time Manager
This extension is a GM tool which provides an interface for easy time tracking and management.

This extension is heavily-based on Clock Adjuster which is the work of pr6i6e6st.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Classic](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsClassic.php) 3.3.12 and [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.0.1 (2020-11-04).

To use this extension, you need to have the Calendar module enabled and have your calendar configured.

To use the 'advance time to 6am/12am' buttons, you must first have set the time. The easiest way to do this is to advance the time manually 1 minute by entering 1 in the minutes field and double-clicking 'Add'.
